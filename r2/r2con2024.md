# Running over STM8

In this talk we will explore reusing e-waste for multiple purposes:

1. Improving the r2 analysis and pseudo-C of the STM8 8-bit microcontrollers, still ubiquitous IC in consumer electronics.
1. Leveraging r2ai and decai to accelerate our firmware decompilation efforts.
1. Exploring project decompilation via custom decai prompting while swapping and comparing inference backend performance.
1. Have good project management skills and finishing this project and talk in time for demonstration, thanks to generative AI.
